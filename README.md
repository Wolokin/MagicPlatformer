# Magic Platformer

Magic platformer is a competitive game to be played with your friends. It is a
dynamic 2D arcade platformer, where the main objective is to be the last one alive.
Gameplay revolves around using various spells to deal damage your opponent(s),
while simultaneously running and jumping on platforms to avoid being hit and
collect pick-ups.

## Installation

You have two options to install the game. You can either download the latest
release, or build the game yourself in Unity.

### Downloading the latest release

## Quick start

### Start menu

After running the game, you will be greeted with the start menu. From here you
can select the number of players (2-4), the skin of each player and the input
they will use. Note: for the player to spawn, the input needs to be present,
i.e. if you select a controller as an input, but there is no controller
connected, the player will not spawn.

When you're ready with your selections, proceed to select 'Map 1' at the bottom
to start fighting.
